Idea: Structure for creating modular EAs. The idea is to create robots with several different engines talking to each other or just a mechanism in a simple way to test various combinations of strategies. Similar to the Trio Orchestra where it uses 3 motors of the classic Ilan with different input signals.

An engine will only be a piece of the main EA.

Example of engines : xBest / Ilan / TrendFolowEa , etc ...

An example of use is to leave an xBest engine only on purchase and another Ilan only on sale to test both at the same time on the backtest

One canceling Drawdow from the other.
