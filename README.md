Ideia.
Structure for creating modular EAs. The idea is to create robots with several different engines talking to each other or just one mechanism in a simple way to test various combinations of strategies.

An engine will only be a piece of the main EA.

Example of xBest / Ilan / TrendFolowEa mechanism etc ...

An example of use is to leave an xBest engine only on purchase and another Ilan only on sale to test both at the same time in the backtest

One canceling Drawdow from the other.
